# Wild test files

This repository contains binary files used by some of Wild's tests. It's
separate so that if it gets too large, we can prune commits or otherwise
rewrite history in order to reduce its size, things that we definitely don't
want to do with the main wild repository.

Files should be added in subdirectories with a README saying where the file
came from and any licensing information related to the file.
